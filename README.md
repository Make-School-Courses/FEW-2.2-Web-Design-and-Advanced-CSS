## Class Assignments

We will begin the term reviewing CSS concepts. Then move into new concepts that you will apply to your projects. The final project is to build a CSS framework. 

1. [ ] [CSS Drawing Examples](Assignments/assignment-01.md)
    - Recreated the images in the example file
1. [ ] [CSS Custom Drawing](Assignments/assignment-02.ms)
    - Created your own custom drawing or logo
1. [ ] [CSS Animation Examples](Assignments/assignment-03.md)
    - Recreated the animations in the example file
1. [ ] [CSS Custom animation](Assignments/assignment-04.md)
    - Animated your custom drawing or logo
1. [ ] [Explore SASS](Assignments/assignment-06-SASS.md)
    - Added SASS to a past project 
        - [ ] Used at least three variables 
        - [ ] Used one mixin
        - [ ] Used one other SASS feature loop, function etc. 
1. Improve Your Typography
1. CSS Framework
    - Use the checklist [here](Assignments/project-css-framework.md) to complete your CSS framework.
1. Web Components 
    - [ ] Completed Web Component tutorial
    - [ ] Add web compomnent to your framework

### Custom CSS Framework

You will be building a CSS framework to use for the frontend of any web project. It's like making your own [Bootstrap!](https://getbootstrap.com/). It's about time that someone challenged Bootstrap and produced a viable replacement that is leaner, more flexible, and easier to use by implementing new CSS tools. 

You'll build this framework throughout the course, with a midterm check-in to show progress and get feedback, as well as a final presentation in front of the class, where you show an example of your framework in use on a web app (previous project, sample static page used for the demo, etc.)

## Evaluation
