## Why this assignment?

SASS is a common industry-standard tool, expect to see it in use at any place you may work. You should know what it is and how it works. By implementing SASS in your work you will get a close-up view of what it does and how to work with it.

## Project requirements

You'll turn in each of the three parts to this assignment to Gradescope.

### Part 3. Apply SASS to a past project 

Choose a past project that has a style sheet. Rewrite that style sheet in SASS.

The project you choose can be any web project a past assignment, a past intensive project, or a personal project.   

**PROTIP!** Projects created with `Create React App` can use SASS out of the box! 

Choose a project that has a reasonable scope. A large group project might not be a good choice here. You need to be able to finish it this week. 
 
**PROTIP!** Resist the urge to revamp the actual styling if that is a time blocker for you, the goal here is to familiarize yourself with SASS
