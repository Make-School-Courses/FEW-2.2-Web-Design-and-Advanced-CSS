# FEW 2.2 - Intro to SASS - Part 2

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to apply SASS to your previous assignment where you created a CSS Animation. 

Look for areas where you can use all of the various features of SASS. 

- [Variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) 
- [Math and operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric)
- [Nested rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules#nesting)
- [import and Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import#import-and-modules)
- [Flow Control](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control) 
	- @if and @else
	- @each
	- @for
	- @while
- [Lists](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/lists) 
- [Built in Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules)
	- Color
	- List
	- Map
	- Math

## Why this assignment?

SASS is a common industry-standard tool, expect to see it in use at any place you may work. You should know what it is and how it works. By implementing SASS in your work you will get a close-up view of what it does and how to work with it.

## Project requirements

Submit a link to your work on GradeScope. 

### Apply SASS to your CSS Animation

Apply SASS to your CSS animation (this is the assignment from the previous week.) You can start by changing the file extension of your style sheet to `.scss`.

You should make use of the following elements in your code: 

- variables
- math operators
- for loops
- nested rules

### Stretch goals: 

- SASS has a few more features that you can make use of. Apply these your code: 
	- @import
	- @mixin
	- SASS Modules https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules
- Get started on Part 3 of SASS challenges: [Part 3](./assignment-06-SASS-part-3.md)

### Deliverable

Each of the three parts of this assignment will be submitted via GradeScope. 

### Due date

Class 5

## Assessing the assignment

| Expectations | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Completion | You have minimally applied SASS or not at all | You have looked every line of CSS and applied SASS at each applicable point | You can found new and interesting ways to apply SASS, you've probably used mixins, functions, and loops |
| Quality | The code is poorly written, only you would understand it | Your code is well written. Names are well-chosen and descriptive. | Even you are impressed with your code. The comments rival what you see on very popular repos. |
| Comprehension| Can't explain concepts covered | Can explain the concepts covered | Could apply these concepts to new and future projects with ease |
| Work ethic | few massive commits | Commits outline progress | Clearly show the progression of the work, with descriptive commit messages |
