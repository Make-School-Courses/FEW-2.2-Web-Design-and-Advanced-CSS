# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 7 - Nav Bar and Footer

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to add a navbar to your framework. You'll use CSS Flexbox arrange the elements in your nav bar. 

### Why this assignment?

Mastering Flexbox is essential to being a front end master. You'll want to arrange some things on a page for output at some point. Flexbox is a tool for describing how things are aligned on a single axis. 

## Project requirements

You need to design a nav bar for your CSS Framework. Use CSS variables to make your nav bar share colors, fonts, and sizes used elsewhere in your code. 

Your nav bar can look like anything you envision. That said keeping it simple will allow you to complete this part of the framework on time. Don't try to do too much here. The framework just needs to create a default nav bar that looks acceptable. 

Get started by looking at and examining the decisions and code used to create the Bootstrap Navbar and Foundation Topbar. 

_If you are at a loss for ideas as to how to design your navbar recreate the Bootstrap or Foundation bars_ 

Your Nav Bar should: 

- Display a title 
- Display a list of links
- Arrange all elements with Flexbox

- Arrange all of the elements from left to right
- Has some color or style that sets it apart from the rest of page
### Stretch goals
  - Has an option to arrange links on the left and right
  - Has an option for a dropdown menu. You can create a drop down menu with only css. Here is some info:

    - https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-css-dropdown-menus/
  - Make your navbar mobile-friendly with a hamburger menu

**You should also document the navbar styles in your framework documentation.**

Document your styles by 

- Showing some sample markup need to create the menu.
- Include any notes about special class names or other options that are supported. 

## Footer 

You should design a footer. Use a class name for the footer container. 

The footer should arrange lists (ul) in a row using flexbox. 

The footer should also style the background and foreground colors in an appropriate way. You may need to change the link color to make it make sense in the context of the footer. Use the descendant selector to target these elements and override styles that need to be chnaged.  

### Deliverable

All of the code for the Navbar is in your framework css repo. 

Your readme documents Navbar. 

The code for your footers are added to your framework repo. 

Documentation for the footer added to your framework documentation. 

### Due date
