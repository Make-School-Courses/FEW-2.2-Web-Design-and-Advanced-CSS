# FEW 2.2 - CSS Drawing

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to recreate all 16 drawings from the example file ([assignment-01.html](assignment-01.html)) but resized from  `50px by 50px` to `100px by 100px` (twice their size).

It's important to understand the CSS concepts used here. You should try and do these on your own but can peek at the source code if you get stuck. 

### Why this assignment?

To be a master at CSS you should be able to push it to it's limits. CSS wasn't really meant as a tool for drawing which is what makes this a challenge!

Creating the drawings in this assignment will giev you an opportunity to practice with CSS position absolute and transform properties. 

## Project requirements

- Recreate each drawing but resized to `100px by 100px` 
- Make them look as identical as possible


### Stretch Goals 

If you've solved these problems and want some more challenges try these. 

- Use a gradient fill
  - Give the leaf shape a darker and light green on each half
  - Use a gradient to give the lemmon a shadow
  - Make Kirby look more round
- Get started on your custom CSS drawing [assignment-2](assignment-02-css-drawing.md)
