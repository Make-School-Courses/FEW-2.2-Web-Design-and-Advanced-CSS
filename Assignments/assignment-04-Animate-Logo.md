# FEW 2.2 - Animate your Drawing

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to add some motion to your CSS drawing. Take the previous assignment where you created a drawing with CSS and apply animation to the elements in the drawing. 

Make an effort ot use both transition and keyframe. 

### Why this assignment?

Animation adds spice and interest to your work. It can also improve user experience. Your favorite apps all use animation to some degree. If you want to make engaging applications you'll need to make them move!

## Project requirements

Starting with the previous assignment, where you drew a logo or icon with CSS, add animation.

You must **animate at least three properties**. For example: `background-color`, `tranform: scale() rotate()`. Animate more if you dare! 

### Stretch Goals
- Make your animation cross-browser compatible if not already
