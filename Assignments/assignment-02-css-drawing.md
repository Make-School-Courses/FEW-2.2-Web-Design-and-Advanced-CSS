# FEW 2.2 - CSS Drawing

## Description  

CSS Drawing. The goal of this assignment is to improve your skill and understanding of CSS. The deliverable is a drawing made entirely with CSS. 

You can draw anything, but challenge yourself to draw something that tests your skills. Here are a few ideas: 

- Logo - Recreate an existing logo in CSS
- Custom Logo - Create a logo for one of your own projects or products in CSS. 
- Self portrait - Draw yourself in CSS
  - While CSS has limitations, you can still do some amazingly detailed images: https://diana-adrianne.com/purecss-francine/

It's probably best, and I would prefer, that you stick with bold and graphic shapes using solid fills and strokes.

### Why this assignment?

To be a master at CSS you should be able to push it to it's limits. CSS wasn't really meant as a too for drawing which is what makes this a challenge!

If you can drawing something amazing with CSS you'll be able to figure out how style some fonts in boxes on a page. Besides we'll be looking at fonts and and more conventional styles later in the term.
