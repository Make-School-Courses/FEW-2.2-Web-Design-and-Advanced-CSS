# FEW 2.2 - CSS Animation

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to recreate the animations in the demo file. 

Recreate the animations in the demo file here: [Animation Challenges](assignment-03-Animation.html)

Open this file in your browser. Your job is to recreate what you see. If you need a hint use the browser's inspector. 

### Why this assignment?

Animation adds spice and interest to your work. It can also improve user experience. Your favorite apps all use animation to some degree. If you want to make engaging applications you'll need to make them move!

## Project requirements

Recreate the animations in the demo file on your own. Some of these animations use CSS Animation with Key frames and other use CSS transitions. Do your best to do these on your own. You can peek at the source code of the demo file for a hint if you get stuck.
