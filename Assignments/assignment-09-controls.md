# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 6 - Framework: Controls 

## Description 

The goal is to make progress on the CSS framework and focus on controls. 

### Why this assignment?

Great looking forms set sites apart. The default styles for form elements leave a lot to be desired. 

## Project Requirements

Add styles to your CSS frame that create reasonable styles for form controls. You should style these elements:

- `button`
- `input[text]`, `input[email]`, `input[password]`
- `input[radio]`, `input[checkbox]`
- `textarea`

Decide on how you will use SASS. Remember SASS will need to be compiled. 

Definitely use CSS Custom Properties apply common values and calculate related values where possible. 

### Stretch Goals

There are more input types than: text, email, and password. These also appear differently than a standard text field and will appear different across browsers. 

When styling these be sure to use the label to your advantage where appropriate. For example input[file] might best be _handled with the label while the input itself is hidden_.

- `input[file]`
- `input[search]`
- `input[color]`
- `input[date]`
- `input[image]`

You may want to search examples of these in the wild and look at how other frameworks handle these to inform your choices. 

Make some custom Radio buttons and check boxes. Follow this guide:

## Deliverables

Your new styles for controls should be added to your framework. 

Documentation for your framework. Include a code snippet showing markup for each element your framework styles. 

So far your framework CSS should support the following: 

- Basic font styles, including: 
  - Should style p, h1-6, strong, em, and a tags
- Buttons
  - Style button
- Styles form elements
  - input, type: text, email, password
- Styles the radio buttons and check boxes:
  - input type: radio and checkbox

## Assessing the assignment

| Expectations | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Completion   | You have not styled control elements button, input, textarea, or the styles you have written are not complete | You have styled all elements: button, input, textarea, checkbox, radio button. Your styles feel complete and make good use of Custom Properties and possibly SASS. | Besides the default elements you have extended your styles to cover a wide range of input types. |
| Quality | The styles don't improve on the default styles applied by the browser | Your form elements read well and look better than the default appearance of these elements. | Your controls look as good or better than the same controls in other frameworks. |
| Comprehension | Can't explain how and why you are making this CSS framework | Can easily example the use of CSS applied to the controls you have created. | You have a big picture understanding of how SASS and CSS custom properties could work together in a complex stylesheet. You have a strong understanding of pseudo classes and how they are used in your framework |
| Work ethic | few massive commits | Commits outline progress. Your read clearly documents the use and application of your framework | You have clearly outlined the progress and future extensions of your framework in your readme. |
