While you have much work into your framework at this point it's time to wrap up the project.

## Project requirements

Your framework should style these things:

- Text - Set the base font family, color, line height, and font size
  - Headers - h1-h6
  - Links - a, 1:hover, a:active, a:visited
  - Inline tags - strong, em, mark
  - Block quote
- Controls - form elements
  - input[text], input[email], input[password]
  - button
  - input[checkbox], input[radio]
- Navbar
- Footer

Your framework should be hosted on GitHub Pages. Follow this [guide](https://pages.github.com).

Your GitHub repo should have a README that documents your framework.
